# Refactoring Code

## Refactoring with a Focus on Accessibility

The focus of this first bootcamp assignment was to refactor an existing website specifically to edit the site meet web accessibility standards, descriptive tags such as nav, title, alternative text for images. 

## Getting Started
In a bigger project, these instructions would get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. The deployment section below would give you notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites
This section would define any prerequisites for getting the project to work on your local machine for deployment and testing.

For example, this website is not optimized for viewing on a small device, such as a smartphone. You need a web browser on a desktop, laptop, (or possibly a tablet) to display the site as intended.

## Installing
There is no installation necessary for this project.

In a larger project there would be a list of steps to take for installation. For example:

* First step

* Second step

* Third step

* Fourth step

This section could end with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a demo.

## Running the tests

Go to the project website:
 
Explore it, clicking on links and hovering on images, tab through the page to discover which items are selected with Tab key.

In a larger project, this section would explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

* Break down into end-to-end tests, whatever those are.

* Explain what these tests actually test and why.

### Here's an example
And coding style tests (don't know what these are yet)
Explain what these tests test and why (ditto)
